I found this article very helpful. Before this class, I had always assumed that to make a website you would just dive right into it. Since I don't have a whiteboard/chalkboard readily available, I think I will use this article's advice and sketch out the flow/recipe page on paper. Having read this, I left curious to see what the next steps (beyond marking up) are, and how this sketch becomes a real website. I am excited to see how this can grow, and I am eager to look at more webpages with this in mind. Thank you, Ben.
