## HW - Begin working on your final project!

Get started/Keep working on your final project! I recommend starting with containers and your grid system, rows and columns before filling out content. Just like the Midterm, your Final requires _at least one_ media query for mobile (<768px).

If you are continuing with your midterm project, make sure you do enough work to warrant another project and presentation!

## Final Project Options:

### Continue with Midterm Ideas

If you choose this option – you MUST add in enough new features for it to qualify as a secondary substantial project!

- Modify Bootstrap’s CSS and JavaScript enough to make the site look like a custom build. No default bootstrap colors, fonts, etc.

- Site should be a completed site for final, no missing pages.

- Add in some sort of custom javascript, jquery outside of bootstrap defaults. Attempt to implement an external javascript framework.

### All New Website Idea:

Come up with a completely new idea for the final.

- If you use Bootstrap, you must modify Bootstrap’s CSS and JavaScript enough to make the site look like a custom build. No default bootstrap colors, fonts, etc.

- Site should be substantial.

- Complete HTML CSS site execution with optional JS based on functionality

**OR**

- A site with some well executed creative JavaScript functionality.

### Class topics for the remaining classes include:
