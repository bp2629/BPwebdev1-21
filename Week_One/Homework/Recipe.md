# Baked Potato
I grew up in Idaho. When I tell people this, one of two things happen: "Whats Idaho?" or (*in a slightly less favorable scenario*) I get something involving the word "Potato". So, this leaves me with two options: Ignore it, or lean into it... So here we go:

- Potato
- Butter  
- Cream Cheese 
- Chives
- Shredded Cheese
- Baco' bits
- Other Toppings of your choosing (maybe Broccoli if your crazy)

1. Prepare Potato by stabbing with fork, Creating little holes.
2. Place in microwave ~ 5 minutes
3. Take out with oven mitt 
4. Slit with knife
5. Place butter in potato and wait to melt
6. Insert the rest of your toppings
